Hello there! 
welcome to my second-brain / digital garden. 

This is a place for me to publish my class notes and other personal projects. Though I'll be using this to publish my class notes, I cant really tell what exactly will be uploaded here, I might use it for anything and everything. 

You can explore and have a look around, I hope you find this garden useful or fun in anyway. And if you'll be using any of the content within this website for anything other than strictly educational please contact me first; since I might not have absolute rights for everything inside of here . 

There might be some issues or inaccuracies within the class notes regarding of my subjects as I am learning these subjects as well. So if you find anything finicky open up an [issue](https://github.com/KavinduNirmal/quartz/issues) in github and I'll get it fixed asap ðŸ¤—ðŸ˜…
