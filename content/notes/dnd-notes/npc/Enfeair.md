[[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Enfeair]] Is the first celestial dragon that the party encountered. The party stumbled across the great temple of [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Enfeair]] when they were scouring the old elven fortress under the ocean in the [[The Hollow Zone]]. After [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] used his telepathic connection to converse with the slumbering dragon it showed itself to [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] and asked them what they are doing. After looking at the group to see if they are worthy the dragon made the group her apostolates and serve the "Empress". Ordering them to find the "Princess" after reforging the "Sword". The group accepted and she marked them with her protection.
