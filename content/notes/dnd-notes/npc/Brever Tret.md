Brever Tret is a human in their mid forties. He is the town master of [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Iorville]]. The party was given two bounties by him in the early sessions by him. First was to find the cause of the murders that happened inside the town's iron mine while the other being a backup to the martials. The party had good relations at first but it is uncertain after the betrayal by the party to the town.
