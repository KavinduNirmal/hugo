[[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Lady Galladria]] is the speaker of the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Elder council of Elysian]]. The group were contacted often by her. She accompanied [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Master Sorvel]]. She attempted to read [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn]]'s mind which lead to a arguement with her and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]]. However she was patient and strict. She was the one who guided the group out of [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Elysian]]. She gave the group parting gifts and warned them about the ever watching [[notes/dnd-notes/other/Golden Aurora]]. She handed them a letter to be delivered to [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Thymaria]] which was later delivered by [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Hector]].
