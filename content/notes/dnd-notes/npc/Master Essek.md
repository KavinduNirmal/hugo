[[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Master Essek]] was a council member of the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Elder council of Elysian]]. He didn't make much contact with the group but [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]]. Once he noticed the hidden arcane of [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]], he asked Aralos to come under him to train and that he will teach him to resurface the hidden power[^1] that [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] had. Upon his request [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] secretly trained under him inside a pocket dimension that was created by [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Lady Galladria]] for two years. Though it was only 2 weeks for the party.
