[[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Hell's Gate]] is a huge ravine / split on earth that spans across twelve miles. It branches off like a Y and has a width of half a mile. It is rumored that in the [[notes/dnd-notes/other/Great Divergence]] there was an ancient elven fortress here. One of the battle front took place here and the power elves unleashed created the ravine.
