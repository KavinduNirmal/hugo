## Description
Zelenya is the largest continent in all of [[private/Aisillra√©e]]. Its topography is almost magical and unbelievable for one as it is divided into two polar opposite climate. The western region of Zelenya is completely filled with lush and beautiful ran forests and jungles while the eastern side of it is covered with harsh deserts and sand dunes. Dividing the two of them stands a great canyon named *unknown*. The party started their journey in the east of this continent. Holding the power of the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Empire Of Sun]] over this land is [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Thymaria]] appointed as the duke of the empire by the [[Overlord]] himself.
