[[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Elysian]] is a secret underground city situated in a deep cavern under the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Hell's Gate]]. Hidden away from the rest of the world this place is a safe heaven for spell casters and mages that are hiding from the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials]] and [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Umber Knights]]. 

Elysian has its own rules and a guard called [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/The Revelry]]. It is ruled by five council members through the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Crystal Domain]].  The party were guided to this city in the third session by [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]]. where they met with the council members and spend two weeks of down time till the heat was cleared.
