[[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Iorville]] is a small town situated in the southern edge of the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Bash'quet Desert]]. Placed along the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Sacred Trail]] it is constructed around a large pond. Hard to find in the arid desert the town is situated in. However because of this the town thrive as a normal town with clean water for farming and other business. 

The main interest as in terms of trade goods are the iron mined from the town mine. This mine is the reason that the town has named what it is called. In the second session; the group was given a task by the town master of the town to head down to this mine to inspect the sudden murders that happened within the new sector of the mine.

The town was also used as a stop by camp by the martial prisoner convoy. At first the town master seeked help from the group to be as backup guards for the said convoy but the group decided to betray under the special circumstances and leave the group with [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/The Revelry]].
