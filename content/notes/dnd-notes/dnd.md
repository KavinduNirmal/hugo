# D&D as a game.

Creating worlds and worldbuilding is one of my long time hobbies, Thinking of adventures coming up with stories are such a fun thing to think for me. Though I mainly focused on story writing I haven't dipped my toe into building a full living world up until recently.  

Getting introduced to D&D was such a blast, I didn't know I'd find a game that would intrigue me and make me excited this much.  So I spent my time creating a world that my friends can explore. A world living inside my head and a story told by the actions of my friends. I've met a wonderful group of players who inspires me to work on this world and make me happy that they enjoy it. Please have a look around of my fantasy world [[private/Aisillraée|Aisillraée]]

## D&D Campaign

The world I've created is a low magic, mid-fantasy world with many stories flowing simultaneously. [[private/Aisillraée|Aisillraée]] is a world of terror, tyranny a world filled with injustice and discrimination. A world where citizens try to forget a great war and survive in this unfair land. 

The story is progressed by 5 wonderful characters.
