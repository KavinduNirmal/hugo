Martials are the lowest policing unit of the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Empire Of Sun|Empire]] that is assigned to all of the continents. They are deployed all over the continents to every major towns and all cities. Martials are mainly consist of humans, because of the nature of humans being racist towards all the other races than humans seeking any help from this group as a lawful unit is not something that a normal citizen believes in. Because of this they don't really get approached by normal citizens for any feuds. Their main objectives are fight against roaming monsters and arrest and eliminate any arcane users they find. The group had many encounters with them, most of them are unpleasant.
