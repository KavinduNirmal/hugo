[[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/The Revelry]] is a hidden organization in [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Elysian]] under the masters of the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Crystal Domain]]. They work along with the council to rescue arcane users and fight against the martials as a guerrilla force. The party was first introduced to the name in the second session when they ran into a group of fighters that was attacking [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Iorville]] to free the prisoners.
