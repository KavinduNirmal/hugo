[[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Golden Dragon Merchants|The Golden Dragon Merchants]] was a group of slavers the group encountered in [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Red Coast]]. The group managed to save the three slaves they had at the moment. The group also bought three animals from the merchants which are now the [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Companions|pets]] of the group. After leaving [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] went back to the tent at night and stole the money they paid the merchants along with the rest of the money they had and few letters. After almost getting caught the group killed two slavers marking them as mages and stole their ship [[notes/dnd-notes/other/Wooden Dragon|Sylvia]] and escaped to the open seas.
