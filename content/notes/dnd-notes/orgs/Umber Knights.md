The [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Umber Knights]] are the elite knights of the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Empire Of Sun|Empire]]. They are dispatched to neutralize high magical threats. The group almost got caught by one of them in session 15 when [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] unknowingly used the [[notes/dnd-notes/other/Celestia's Sword]]. Which unleashed a boosted 9th level spell (*Lightning Bolt (true level 15*)). However the weather and the surrounding helped the party to escape the immediate demise.
