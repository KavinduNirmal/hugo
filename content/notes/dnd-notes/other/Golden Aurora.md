*Visual representation, its more faint and unable to detect if you are not specifically looking it. But its appearance is the same.*

![Golden Aurora](notes/images/golden-aurora.png)

[[notes/dnd-notes/other/Golden Aurora]] is some sort of a arcane detection web that span across the entire land of [[private/Aisillra√©e]]. There are no definite information about the origin or how it works. The group was warned about the existense of this thread by [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Lady Galladria]]. After being aware, it was first detected by the eagle eyes of [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]]. 

When [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] used the [[notes/dnd-notes/other/Celestia's Sword]] in [[Session 15]] to destroy [[Rodrego Fransisco|Fransisco's]] ship they noticed the aurora shifting and lighting up as if it felt the powerful magic output.
