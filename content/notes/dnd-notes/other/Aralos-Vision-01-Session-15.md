[[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] woke up in a cavern that stenched unlike anything he ever smelled. walking through the man built corridoor he was faced with a figure cladded in armor and draped over black robes that he after realized was an [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Umber Knights|Umber Knight]]. The figure almost acted as if they saw Aralos. The figure ordered to few [[Seekers]] telling them that they felt something wrong and find the reason behind it.

The [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Umber Knights|Umber Knight]] walked through [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] as if he was a ghost. But the figure stopped and looked back as if they sensed something. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] tried to touch the figure's shoulder which made them snap their head at the place [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] touched. Before [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] could do anything he was pulled my a force into the front of a massive vault door. 

Walking through the door, [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] saw a female figure. Inside the vault. Cuffed with multiple massive gold chains that has thousands of glistening dwarven runes. The figure had pale white skin, silver long hair that reached her ankles, but they were floating in air in the airless apace. Her eyes was closed. She was breathing. She had long pointy ears, she was about 10 feet tall. Before [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] could he was pulled out of the vault through the ground on top of a snowy mountain. Showing a grand fortress on the peaks of a three mountains. With the word "Find" repeated in his head, he woke up.
