The [[notes/dnd-notes/other/Great Divergence]] was an ancient war took place ~700 years ago that resulted the extinction of elves. History written history states that the high court of the elven kind grew power hungry to take over the entire world thus started massacring and invading lands. As a result the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Empire Of Sun]] declared war against them. The elves used underhand powerful magic to annihilate innocent and thus as a punishment the Emperor ordered banishment of all mages. After that war no elf was seen on the face of [[private/Aisillra√©e]]. 

The party saw a different perspective of the war through a vision the celestial dragon [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Enfeair]] showed them. A part of human army under the flag of now [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Empire Of Sun]] started massacring innocent elves while, they saw elves, humans, dragons and dwarves fighting against the invasion in front of a massive glistening city. The city had a crest of a side profile of a beautiful woman surrounded by a dragon.
