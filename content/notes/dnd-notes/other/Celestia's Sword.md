Though the true name is unknown the party found a fragment of the sword in the old elven fortress under the [[The Hollow Zone]]. The sword piece was surrounded by a powerful arcane barrier. It was a beautiful sword hilt. Made out of glistening obsidian like metal, the hilt contained a purple ethereal like gem. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn]] after close inspection deduced that the sword was made for a person at the size of at least 10ft tall. The sword was designed to be of a use of a female. Though [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn]] tried to lift it, he could not. The moment he touched it, he took psychic damage. Giving up on it [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] made an attempt. Though he took damage as well, he lifted the sword. He told the group that the sword felt like it was at least 50lbs. 

[[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] noticed that the sword has a voice, that creeps into his mind and talk to him. The moment [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] picked up the sword he had a [[notes/dnd-notes/other/Aralos-Vision-01-Session-15|vision]]. The sword demanded to be full again, the voice of a female rang [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]]'s head. The sword stated that they're only allowing him to take the sword as he is not its true owner. The sword showed Aralos where the "princess" was and demanded to free her.
