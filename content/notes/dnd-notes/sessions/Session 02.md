***Session: 16/10/2022***

Coming out of the mine the party was surprised to see two more [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials]] guarding the entrance of the mine. As the party was informed by the officers the town master sent them as backup after explaining the situation to them. Looking around the party realized the substantial increase of [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials]] stationed around the town. As [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] explained to the party, normally there are mobile patrols that are sent out to remote or small villages to check in occasionally. But that amount is normally would be only 5-6 officers. But unlike a normal patrol there are more officers walking around. 

High on alert the party retreated inside the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Telltale Brewery]] and into their rooms while [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] volunteered to go to the town master's and collect the reward.  Coming to an agreement with the group they went to the town master's office. As they went there they noticed the black carriages with the emblem of the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials]]. At the doorstep  they were stopped by the guards that the town master is busy and to come in later. But the two decided that they would wait around. 

When they looked inside they noticed a figure clad in silver armor, [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] recognizing them as a [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials#Martial Chief|Martial Chief]] which is surprising to be seen along a mobile unit. Not needing more attention from the martials both of them avoided being confronted acting occupied while the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials#Martial Chief|Chief]] passed them by. After the coast is clear they walked inside the office where they noticed a sweaty and stressed looking [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Brever Tret|town master]]. Noticed by the town master he fixed his composure and talked with the two of them. 

Happy with the group's result the [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Brever Tret|town master]] paid them the promised amount of gold. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] then asked him about the increase of martials and why was there a Chief in town. Thought at first he was hesitant, he opened up and told them that they are here to secure the town for a convoy that is said to come later at night. Even he was in dark of what was the said convoy was about but he was uneasy about it. Thus he asked the two if their group was available for another job.

when asked what the town master explained that since he is uneasy about the said convoy and since the town doesn't have many guards to deploy he'd like to hire the group as guards for the town until the martials leave. The two accepts the offer under the price of ***250 gold pieces***. Upon acceptance they were paid ***125 gold pieces***. Walking back to the tavern contemplating what they did they inform the group that they have secured another job for the group with the price of ***125 gold pieces***.

After discussing with the group they formulated a plan to approach the situation, [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] taking the lead to be the face of the group. They walked out onto the streets to grab supplies and do some shopping in preparation for anything and everything not knowing what sort of a situation they might come across. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] approached the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials#Martial Chief|chief]] to inform that they were joining as town guards after which he setup a trap at the entrance of the southern gate. 

When dusk came the group took positions around the town as the town guard announced a curfew to the citizens the group realized it was some serious business. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Hector]] taking positions on-top of two rooftops keeping an eye around while [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] took positions near the town master's house. Mounted on [[Sebastian]], [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] went towards the south gate acting as first defense for anything.

Before mush time went on [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] noticed the trail of smoke coming through on the horizon and informed the group. Alerted the group took battle positions but then realized it was the convoy, three martial carts slowly made their way into the town and parked near the town master's house. The party realized it was a prisoner cart. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] realized there were four individuals, shackled and gagged inside the cart, which were taken inside the house and imprisoned inside of the cages inside the town master's house.

Realizing they are prisoners because they are arcane users [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] felt uncomfortable, but the party knew they cannot make a move at the moment. As night fell the town became incredibly quiet. As midnight came [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] noticed shadows moving along the high grounds outside of the town walls and informed the party, which [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] immediately informed the martials.  Before they could even prepare multiple scorching fire balls were crashed down towards where martials were stationed and the party soon realized they were ambushed by arcane users. 

The party immediately engaged with the ambushers near the town master's house, they were backed up by the martials. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] immediately retreated inside towards his party but unfortunately was casted the spell *crown of madness* by one of the ambusher's along with [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Hector]]. Which was given the order to attack [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]]. Confused as to why their ally's are fighting him [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] noticed the faint smoky crown around their head and informed [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] who went all out apologizing and attacked [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Hector]], meanwhile [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] sneaked inside the town master's house and tried to break out the prisoners. But he realized he's unable to picklock the cage and screamed for [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos|Aralos's]] help. With [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin|Armin's]] attack, [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Hector]] came back to his senses but [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn]] couldn't resist the spell. 

But after a while he was able to resist and break off  of the *crown of madness*,  hearing the scream [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] ran inside the house and helped [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] to free the prisoners and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] jumped out of the window and helped the rest of the party, as [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] casted *spiritual weapon* the ambushers stopped attacking and asked why the party was trying to protect the martials, and asked the group to join them. Though at first the group rejected, they soon realized that the martials have seen them using magic thus the group switched sides and attacked the martials. 

After the nearby martials are taken care of, the ambushers ran inside the house and escorted the prisoners out to one of the martial carriages and drove it off. Seeing reinforcements were coming after the group was invited to join them. Amidst [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin|Armin's]] disagreement, the group decided to follow the ambushers.
