***Session:  08/10/2022***

*The story started in a small town named [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Iorville]] in the continent of [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Zelenya]]. The town was situated at the edge of the vast [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Bash'quet Desert]]. Being a little distance away from the main path, also known as the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Sacred Trail]] meant it didn't  have much of foot traffic. This meant the city was quiet and a peaceful place. Mainly focusing on the iron mine, made its name. But there were occasions where outsiders came to the town. Like when the weather wasn't suitable for travels.*

*For a few days the southern area that surrounds the town and the adjacent area was constantly facing dust storms. This meant that many travelers were looking for shelter from the storms. Many new faces arrived into the town in these days and they helped around the town as they stayed.* 

Sitting down at the bar of the popular tavern in town called [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Telltale Brewery]] Having a peaceful drink while having a friendly chat are [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]]. With the passing sandstorm a lot of the town folk have gathered inside the tavern and has been keeping each other accompanied. Both of them have been in the town for about two days, staying in the tavern and waiting when the weather calm down while deciding on where they are heading. 

At a distant table a little far away from the crowd, [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] looks to be drinking some ale while figuring out some paperwork he received from the local infirmary. Being a traveling healer he has earned respect from the locals. Hiding from the crowd while keeping a close eye on everyone while not get any attention [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] is seen to be leaning on the wall at the corner of the tavern. 

While [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos|Aralos]] is enjoying his drink two dragonborn approaches him to ask him about his whereabouts. After having a small chat they asks the villagers for a brawl to get rid of the boredom. Having this peaked interest [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] accepts and both of them have a brawl in the middle of the tavern. Walking off victorious [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] is praised by [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]].  

While the tavern calms down from the intense brawl they witnessed the tavern doors swing open revealing a frail looking white dragonborn covered in sand. She cries for help from the town folks asking her daughter has not returned home since she went out. She is immediately calmed down and tended by the patrons. But the bartender informs that it is not that suitable to one to go out to look for her daughter in these conditions and perhaps wait for the storm to die out. But she refuses.

When approached by [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] she introduces herself as [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Tilda]] and beg him for help, Seeing her state  [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] agrees to help but only for money. She agrees and hands him all of her belongings, [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti|Urti]] comes forward stating that he will help too but refuses any rewards. Looking at the situation and the state of himself [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos|Aralos]] asks if he could join in too but he's also looking for some compensation. 

Satisfied with the agreement the four of them walks out in the middle of the storm scouring around to find the girl. With the restricted view; they arrive at a forestry where they meet a goblin boy named [[Harrol]]. Though at first the party was suspicious of the workers of the forestry, they later finds out by some intimidation that the goblin boy and his friends were playing with the girl at the edge of the town. But they deiced to play a prank on the girl by not finding her. But before they could find her to bring her back the storm arrived.

Knowing the situation the group went on at the direction where the boy pointed. Trekking towards the edge of the town up towards the cliffs they found the girl surrounded by a pack of hyenas. The group immediately took down the hyenas and approached the girl. She was lying on top of a small cliff and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] noticed that the girl was too weak to take to the town and needed immediate medical attention or otherwise she would perish.

Having no other choice for the sake of a life [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] held to his divine emblem and casted a spell. Though it was done as much stealthily he could it didn't go unnoticed by his companions. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] thought it might be his end considering he has broken the most sacred taboo of the land. But his companions seems to be unfazed and told him that they don't find him to be evil to save a life. After having a discussion together and making a pact to keep the newfound information save on each other they went back to the town with the little girl who was now unconscious but not dead.

When returned to the tavern [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Tilda]] immediately grabbed the girl crying in happiness and thanked the group. Impressed by the feat the town folk thanked them too. They were offered free drinks by the bartender named [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Gilliot]] and then asked if they are looking for any more work. He told the group that he could recommend them to the town master as he was looking for some folks for a job. Interested the party accepted the offer and had a drink and slept the day off.

After taking a good rest at the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Telltale Brewery]] the party met together in the morning at the bar downstairs to discuss about the job [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Gilliot]] was talking about the day before. They were met with a half-dragonborn named [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Hector]] who was interested in the job and working with the group after seeing their dynamic. 

[[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Gilliot]] informed the party that there were three bodies in the new level of the iron mine. The mine was closed down due to this incident. The town master was investigating a possible murderer but he was unable to find any clues or a culprit. Thus he was looking for some outside help to go down to the mine to find any clues of the said incident.

Understanding the situation the party talked through possible scenarios amongst them. The new companion got along with them swiftly. After coming to an agreement with [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Gilliot]] he offered to send a message to the town master while the party had their breakfast. After the food and taking care of other minor details. The party went to the town masters house; a beautifully constructed two story house that stands out from the rest of the town. They were escorted inside by a friendly guard who they didn't catch the name of. 

After meeting the town master the party was met with a human in their mid forties named [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Brever Tret]]. He offered the party the bounty of *100 gold pieces* in return for a satisfactory clues or the culprit themselves. Accepting the bounty you all went down to the mine with the guard who the party was familiar with and entered. The guard opening the gate for them and then standing watch at the entrance. 

Walking inside the party's journey was halted because of the elevator was broken. With no other choice [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] stepped in and casted *mending* on the broken cogs, once again revealing his innate arcane ability, or ***Hocus Pocus*** as [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] likes to call it; to the rest of the party. However once again the party doesn't seemed to be bothered but intrigued. Descending down to the last layer of the mine the party walked through the unrefined mineshafts to find the location the town master mentioned. 

They found  the cave open up into a underground pond. And along the wooden docks the miners made the party found dried blood patches. As they were investigating they felt an eerie presence as they were ambushed by a humanoid creature with a frightening presence, Immediately assuming battle stances [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn]] ran in front assuming the vanguard of the party, [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Hector]] taking the high ground and acting as a hidden sniper while [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] taking the middle. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] immediately jumped into the water taking the creature with him under the water, using his racial ability to stay under water as he was used to it. Though it was easy at first the creature wasn't alone as two more creatures showed up with that [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] passed out just by seeing the frightful creature. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] immediately casted *healing word* and brought him back, but he was too afraid to fight anymore. Finding no other solution [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] casted *spiritual weapon* in a form of a war hammer and attacked the creatures. 

[[notes/dnd-notes/players/Hector]] then noticed that a group was [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials]] were coming through the mineshaft but before he could warn the group they ran towards the battle and assisted the group. But they were surprised to see the floating immaterial war hammer. But with the quick-wit of the group they convinced the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials]]  that it was the doing of the creatures that attacked. Apart from one of the martials the rest of them believed what the party was saying. The said officer faced [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] and questioned him. But with his quick replies [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] escaped and came out alive from that situation.
