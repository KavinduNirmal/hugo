***Session: 06/11/2023***

Escaping from the unneeded turn of events in [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Iorville]] with the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials]], the party escaped with the rebel group called [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/The Revelry]] into the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Bash'quet Desert]] through the guide of [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]] and [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Elandrin]]. Followings [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt|Garratt's]] guide the party lead down into the depths of [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Hell's Gate]] ravine. Where after a long and narrow tunnels with lots of turns they found themselves inside a massive cavern where an underground city was built; that none of the party ever knew or heard of. And [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]] introduced the party to the Under city of [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Elysian]] in an epic way.

The party walked through a stone bridge that was built over a deep moat around the city inside the cavern towards the city. The group were watched over by the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/The Revelry|revelry]]. Walking through the outer wall into the city, the group noticed things that they never noticed in the outside world. Magical lights illuminating, hovering above the city streets. Laughing and smiling citizens, friendly guards, magical and otherworldly creatures that roamed around without a care. Seeing the surrounding the party was overwhelmed, curious and surprised. However [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] felt uncomfortable to the situation they were in. 

Walking through the this circular city, [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]] led the group into the middle of the city where a 12 story beautiful white circular tower was erected. The tower was heavily guarded by the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/The Revelry|revelry]]. [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]] introduced you to the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Crystal Domain]], the city center of [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Elysian]]. Walking inside following [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]] the group were lead to the top floor. The top of the tower was built as of a throne room, but instead of one throne there were five thrones all situated around with four occupants seated them. 

Surprising the party the old man they rescued as a prisoner walked towards one of the seats and sat down after being greeted with the rest. The group was introduced to the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Elder council of Elysian|Elder council]]. The founders of Elysian. An old tortole named [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Master Sorvel]] taking the center seat, who was occupied by a large mystical ever burning serpent. Sitting to his right was a beautiful half-elven sorceress, [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Lady Galladria]]. Sitting to his left was a short but smiling dwarf named [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Master Don]]. Sitting on the furthest right was a mysterious and quiet [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Master Essek]] who had his eyes on [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] eyeing him closely. Sitting on the farthest left was [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Master Azek Twain]], the old elf that the group helped to break free. 

After introductions and the group telling the council about what they were doing and what they wanted [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Lady Galladria]] attempted to read [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn]]'s mind, which resulted a heated discussion with the council members and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] which almost escalated into combat, however [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Master Sorvel]] and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn]] intervened calming both parties down. However, once both parties came to a agreement the group was allowed to stay in the city by the elders. Which the party used for two weeks of exploring the city and to see what it had to offer. 

[[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] was able to get some interest from [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Master Essek]], where he guided [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] and showed him a talent that was burried within him. Master Essek lead [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] to his room, where he showed Aralos the psychic power and manifesting arcane mana weapons out of thin air. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] spent two years with [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Master Essek]] training[^1] inside his *pocket dimension*. 

[[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn]]  and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Hector]] found themselves in a local popular tavern called the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/The tidal ale]] where they spent all of their time drowning in drink while enjoying all the new tastes the city had to offer.

[[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] you found himself amongst the citizens where he helped some people around, before he found a temple called [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/The Temple of The Evermother]] a temple that had space for all the forgotten or the forbidden deities. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] found a room, a gilded and glistening scarlet decorated room that was made for the [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Enchantress]], finally a proper place to worship. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] sat down thinking about his journey and that night [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] saw a dream, a new dream. A memory that was buried, he was with his best friend [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Ash]]. He was happy and safe, then he heard her voice, the enchantress, she spoke to him saying that she was happy that he found her. And that she was always following him, And will always follow him, wherever he may be.

[[notes/dnd-notes/players/Jormund]] found himself in a corner of the city, a place called the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Mother’s Grove]] where he saw magical creatures and met people that had the same ability as him and his father. A tall and soft spoken firbolg named [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Mother Abeth]] that [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Jormund]] met acquaintance with.

[[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] found themselves on a areana / training area called the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Hound’s pit]]  that wall built almost into the eastern wall, where people come to look at some dogfights and punch away their aggression or show off their strength.
