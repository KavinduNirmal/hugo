***Session:  23/10/2022***

Escaping with the mysterious party that attacked [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Iorville]] amongst the shouting of the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials]]. Upon the command of the individual that was riding with the party, the rest of the rebels scattered around making it so the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials]] had to divide up in order to follow pursuit.  

With each other's help the party managed to obscure the trail and headed off the main path to the open lands of the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Bash'quet Desert]]. As they entered they witnessed a trail of a red flair that were shot up into the air in the are of [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Iorville]], noting that the martials are calling for reinforcements the group decided to not to stop and continue on to put some distance and have a lead to the [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/Martials]]. 

Riding on the horses for the better part of the whole night the group came to know of the leader of the party [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]]. A half elven freedom fighter of a group called [[notes/dnd-notes/orgs/The Revelry]]. A group that fights for the freedom of arcane users. He informed the group that they have been pursuing the convoy for two weeks to find an opportunity to attack the convoy since there was an important person captured amongst them.

The group was skeptical at first of their intentions so they kept their distance and kept an eye on them. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] disagreed on what happen and refused to keep on going with them. But upon [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn|Magdorn's]] convincing he agreed to stay until they find out what they are doing.

Making a camp in the desert the group got together to chat through and get to know each other since now they're in a bit of a situation. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Magdorn]] and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Armin]] says that they knew each other for a while and have been fighting together for sometime. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Urti]] reveals that he is a follower of the [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Enchantress]]. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] and [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Hector]] says that they were escaping from something that they could not go back to.

The group noticed that the elder half elf was overly respected by the leader [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]]. Being cautious you all traveled through the dessert four days before you were met with the edge of the great ravine called the [[notes/dnd-notes/locations/Hell's Gate]]. Garret slowly walk to the edge of the ravine and looks around. Before keep moving off the ravine but, he is floating. The party see the hooves of the horse are invincible as if its under water and Garret turns adjacent to the ravine and the party see Garret getting lower and lower as he starts do disappear from their vision as if he's sinking into nothingness.Following garret's lead the party followed him behind,walking off the ravine and they found land. making their way down along the ravine they slowly sunk to the ground level as if they're going underwater and they find themselves on a small path carved along the ravine wall, not more than five-six foot wide and a little steep and they see garret waiting there smirking. "This is how we hide properly"

Going along this path they see its almost 1100 - 1500 feet drop. As they trek down through road only few hundred feet down [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]] stops and face the wall before walking through the wall. Following through, the party find them self in a cave that goes deeper. Following [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]] behind through multiple turns they find themselves on a dead end before as again [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]] walks through. But this time they find themselves in a circular room 50-70 feet in diameter 100 feet tall, man built. making it circular is an arced wall made out of stone in front of them that walls the cavern ceiling to the floors and the group sees a secondary wall in front of this massive wall. A fifty feet tall another blackish stone wall with four towers and a iron gatefilled with dozen of figures, arrows drawn towards them before [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]] removes his mask and speaks a password.

Upon hearing that the bows were lowered and they hear a huge thud as the iron doors starts to slide inwards revealing a pathway through the wall, [[notes/dnd-notes/npc/Garratt]] looks back at them and nods and he leads them through the walls. The group see its a thick wall from what they assumed two walls were just one structure and looking ahead they see a bright beautiful underground city, multi layered and filled with vegetation and beautiful structures build into this massive cavern.
