## Details
[[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] stands at about about 6 feet tall, slender build and quite athletic looking. he has jet black shoulder length hair that is windswept and well travelled, yet well kept and decorative as in the fashion of elves. A thick but neat black beard covers the lower third of [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos|Aralos's]] face, coming to a slight point just under the chin.  [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] looks strangely unremarkable, no defining features or major scars and could easily be overlooked in a crowd. always has a look of distrust on his face, as if he is trying to measure up a person or situation.

[[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] wears a studded leather armor chest piece, deep brown almost black with various overlapping segments to allow for good movement and flexibility. it is well worn but sturdy looking with some noticeable slash marks. a leather belt with multiple pouches can also be seen around the waist. a pair of dark breeches and knee high leather boots with multiple clasps can be seen on the lower half, the boots especially look of good quality but very worn suggesting a lot of travel and use.

[[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] wears a *elven cloak* of deep forest green that flows down his back almost to his feet, it seems to look like a shadow in low light. it is laced with the slightest hint of dark gold trimming. Although [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] looks very unremarkable this cloak seems like it could add an almost royal/regal sense to him in the right circumstance. it is made of a fine material that seems to almost shimmer in the right light. unseen underneath the cloak is a small dagger on his right hip and a rapier on his left, a short bow and quiver are usually slung over his back. 

### Personality 
[[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] is very untrustworthy of other people due to the nature of his life, he is a typical rogue who likes to neither be seen or heard unless necessary and always has his guard up. He believes in respect and keeping his word, as it has gotten him through life and are two principles he holds true to. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] likes to fight for the 'little guy' having been that person himself for a long time and understanding the struggle of less fortunate people. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] feels as though he is just coasting through life with no real end goal. [[notes/dnd-notes/players/Aralos]] does like to have a bit of a joke and mess around with people who he trusts and knows, although this side is not seen very often...

### Background
He's a closed off one.
