| ==       | equal                    | `$x == $y`                                                   |
| ===      | identical                | `$ === $y` (checks if the value and the datatype is similar) |
| `!=`     | not equal                | `$x != $y`                                                   |
| `<>`     | not equal                | `$ <> $y`                                                    |
| `!==`    | not identical            | `$x !== $y`                                                  |

| `<`      | less than                | `$x < $y`                                                    |
| `>=`     | greater than or equal to | `$x >= $y`                                                   |
| `<=`     | less than or equal to    | `$x <= $y`                                                   |
| `<=>`    | spaceship                | `$x <=> $y` (returns an integer less than or equal to)       |
