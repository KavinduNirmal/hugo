Augmented assignment operators are fancy way of doing assignments, this is accomplished by removing the repeating variable and shifting the position of the operators. This will create a completed augment assignment.

you can read the above as: the new value of `x` is whatever it was `+1`.

| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| `x += y`   | `x = x + y` | Addition       |
| `x -= y`   | `x = x - y` | Subtraction    |
| `x *= y`   | `x = x * y` | Multiplication |
| `x /= y`   | `x = x / y` | Division       |
| `x %= y`   | `x = x % y` | Modulus        |
