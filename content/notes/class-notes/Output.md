## PHP Output

Notably there are two main ways of displaying data through PHP. them being;
1. [[notes/class-notes/Print Statement|Print]][^14]
2. [[notes/class-notes/Echo Statement|Echo]][^15]

Both `print` and `echo` are basically similar to each other, they both display data on the webpage. The difference between the two are quite small. while the `echo` returns no value `print` returns `1`. Another thing to note is ==that ==`print` ==cannot handle no more than one parameter==. If subjected to more than one parameter[^16] it will throw an error. Meanwhile `echo` statement can take in multiple parameters.

>Both `echo` and `print` statements can be used with or without parenthesis. Both `print` and `print()` are valid as well both `echo` and `echo()`
